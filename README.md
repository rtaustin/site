# Netlify CMS Template (Based on Bael CMS)

![Bael](https://i.imgur.com/e1zmiB2.jpg "CMS Template for Netlify")

> This is a free template that gives you an easy way to start a site or blog that uses modern technologies like static-site JAMstack architecture, CSS grid layout, responsive design, and fuzzy search â€” all wrapped up in a pretty sweet style.

## Info

This template runs using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Netlify CMS](https://netlifycms.org), and is hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com). It requires an account with Netlify and Github/Bitbucket to deploy. Based on Bael made by [Jake 101](https://jake101.com)

## Deploy to Netlify

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/jake-101/bael-template)


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

## Edit content

Access `yourwebsite.com/admin`, e.g. `localhost:3000/admin`.

## Manage dynamic routes

When you use Netlify CMS' `folder` type, you actually create dynamic routes. For example, when creating a blog,
you render different content files with the same template. And for the blog to know which content to render,
it looks at the url and gets the specific content file. That's a dynamic route.

So If you create a `folder` type with Netlify CMS, add the folder as glob to the `dynamicRoutes` variable
in the `nuxt.config.js`.
